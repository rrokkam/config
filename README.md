# configuration files

Idempotent and easy, using dotbot. Run ./install from the current directory to set up dotfiles. The configuration information is in install.conf.yaml. 

I would be remiss if I didn't link you to [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).


This set of configurations is a work-in-progress. It is meant for MacOS, though at some point if I find myself wanting something like this for Linux often enough, then I will extend the ./install script a bit.

In the legacy folder you can find the configurations/utilities that I used while in college and especially in my internship.
